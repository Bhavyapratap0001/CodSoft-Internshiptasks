# Internship Project - Java Programming<br> 
This repository contains the work I completed during my internship. The focus of my internship was on Java programming, where I undertook several tasks to enhance my skills and contribute to the projects.
<br><br>
#Project Overview<br>
This project is a compilation of the tasks I completed during my internship. Each task is designed to address specific challenges or implement particular features using Java. The tasks demonstrate my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.

 Tasks Completed
 <br><br>
*Task 1: [NUMBER GAME]*
- Description:<br>
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
You can incorporate additional details as follows:
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
  
   
*Task 2: [STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR]*
- Description:<br>
Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.<br>
Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.<br>
Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
average percentage.<br>
Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.<br>
Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user   
   
   
*Task 3: [ATM INTERFACE]*
- Description:<br>
1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.   
  

*Task 4: [CURRENCY CONVERTER]*
- Description:<br>
Currency Selection: Allow the user to choose the base currency and the target currency.<br>
Currency Rates: Fetch real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.<br>
Amount Input: Take input from the user for the amount they want to convert.<br>
Currency Conversion: Convert the input amount from the base currency to the
target currency using the fetched exchange rate.<br>
Display Result: Show the converted amount and the target currency symbol
to the user.
